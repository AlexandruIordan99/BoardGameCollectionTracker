Personal project focused on the Spring and Angular frameworks. Currently users can register, activate their accounts 
and add board games to the website. The board games they personally add to the website are also added to their collections
The users can wishlist games, they can alter the description of games they own in case they made a mistake when 
writing it on upload, and they can archive (soft delete through patch mapping) the games they no longer have 
in their collections.
