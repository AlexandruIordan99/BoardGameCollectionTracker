Personal project focused on the Spring and Angular frameworks. For now, users can register and activate their accounts. The backend work for adding/removing, rating and reviewing board games is complete. 
The authentication and registration process also works on the frontend. The users can reach the main page of the website and can interact with the menu at the top of the page. The boardgames can now be displayed, and other elements of the interface, such as adding a new board game from the frontend itself, are now being worked on.
